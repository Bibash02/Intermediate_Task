# Task 1: To-Do-List Application
I built a command-line to-do list application using Python. Users can add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 
The tasks are stored in a JSON file to ensure data persistence. I implemented basic error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as trying to delete a task that doesn’t exist.

# Task 2: Data Scraper
I developed a data scraping application using Python. It uses the requests library to fetch web page content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. 
I extracted specific elements such as article titles and saved the data into a CSV file. 
This project helped me understand HTTP requests, HTML structure, and data extraction.

# Task 3: API Integration
I created a Python script that integrates with an external API to fetch real-time data. I used the requests library to make GET requests, parsed the JSON response, and displayed the data in a readable format. I also implemented error handling to manage failed requests, network issues, and invalid responses.
