# Task 1: To-Do-List Application
I built a command-line to-do list application using Python. Users can add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 
The tasks are stored in a JSON file to ensure data persistence. I implemented basic error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as trying to delete a task that doesn’t exist.

# Task 2: Data Scraper
I developed a data scraping application using Python. It uses the requests library to fetch web page content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. 
I extracted specific elements such as article titles and saved the data into a CSV file. 
This project helped me understand HTTP requests, HTML structure, and data extraction.
